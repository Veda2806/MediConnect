MediConnect: Smart Healthcare Management
MediConnect is a professional Android-based healthcare management application for booking doctor appointments, accessing curated medical articles  all in one place.
This project combines Android Studio’s powerful UI capabilities with Firebase for secure authentication and cloud data handling. It does not enforce a specific backend architecture, so you are free to extend or adapt it to your own healthcare solution needs.
